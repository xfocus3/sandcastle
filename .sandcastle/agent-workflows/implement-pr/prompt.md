# PROCESS

For each actionable comment or unresolved thread:

- Change code when the reviewer is right.
- Reply when a reply adds useful context.
- Decline clearly when the requested change is wrong or out of scope.
- Ignore stale/context-only comments.

Run the repository's Java compilation command (e.g. `./mvnw test-compile` or `./gradlew testClasses`, using its configured JDK and wrapper/module/task equivalents) before committing. Run focused tests where relevant.

If you change code, commit with a conventional commit message.

Do not push.
Do not edit labels.
Do not resolve review threads.
Do not create GitHub comments yourself.

When complete, output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`.


## Verification scope

Prove each bug with a failing regression before the fix, then run the focused regression and the relevant neighboring package or affected module, plus compilation and repository formatting checks. Use the configured JDK and Maven/Gradle wrapper. Select broader integration or live-database checks when the changed behavior requires them; do not make the entire upstream CI matrix the default prerequisite for private code review. Run these checks through the configured Actions feedback loop and record exact source revisions, commands, passes, failures, skips, and untested coverage. Never count a timeout, stale run, missing test, or baseline failure as a pass. Report wider checks deferred to upstream CI explicitly; upstream contribution and maintainer requirements still apply. Recheck after review changes.
